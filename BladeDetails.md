- *bad blade arts?
- *insect advantage is very situational
- *has many damage increases agains toppled enemies. Captalize on that?

### #22 Azami
- Aux Cores 2
- Pain for Longing: affinity increase when teammate takes damage; At high trust ranks and setups such as hunter's chemestry, affinity maxes out almost instantly so this has little to no usefullness
  - Thinking of changing it to something that boosts defense at lower HP values, to make her main skill more exploitable
- Vendetta ether spike damage: 300%>450% (trying to make counterspikes more relevant)

### #21 Sever
- Special 3 Effect overlaps with his battle skills
- Heartless Kill: +400% damage on a surprise attack; same problem as finch's skill
- I'm not sure yet, but it seems Armor Pierce and Nullify Defense do the exact same thing

### #20 Poppi QT
- Flash Counter: phys damage counterspike: 320%> 470% (trying to make counterspikes more relevant)
- outside of that, not sure what to do with her

### #19 Akhos
This guy's pretty solid, not much I can do for him
- reduce driver art cooldowns a little bit

### #18 Nim
- Wild Familiars: +80% damage to beasts; Would be nice to change that into something that improves her fusion combo niche role
- Look into "Ultimate Combo" Special for common blades 

### #17 Mikhail
- Improve critical rates

### #16 Wulfric
Aux Core 2>3
- phys def 5% > 
- ether def 5% >

### #15 Brighid
- 

### #14 Zenobia
- 

### #13 Adenine
- Aux Cores 2>3
- Special 1 bonus effect
  - 40% aggro reduction > restores 50% of damage dealt to the whole party, same as nim's; This offers her some healing capability besides just spawning potions)
