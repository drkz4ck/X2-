### #38 Perdido
- Aux Cores 2>3
- physical and ether defenses 5%>10%
- improved attack speed (detailed in weapon section, his main gimmick is improved auto attacks, so I thought a nudge in that direction would make him more relevant)
- reduced art cooldown  (as is it's just way too high)

## =C Tier=
### #37 Cressidus
- *+crit rate
- *Trespass increased damage
- *Senton: works only on specials? verify ; consider improving topple time increase 

### #36 Perun
- Silent Spear (aggro reduction) replaced for Swift Kitty (+45% auto-atk speed); (original doesn't sinergize at all with her main gimmick, which is solo battling, and she needs an edge to be useful both solo and in-party)
- *Defender 40%HP>50%HP

### #35 Obrona
*Not sure what to do with her

### #34 Poppi alpha
- improved atk and art animations
- reduced art cooldowns (She is a great blade, but suffered from the same main problem as the shield hammers)

### #33 Perceval
- Aux Cores 1>3
- *Not sure what to do. I could either make him even more powerful in multi enemy battles or give him something to be useful against a single enemy
- *Increased damage agains humanoids is pretty useless

- improved art recharge rates
- *phys def 5% >
- *ether def 5% >
- *Sickle 40% > 60%

- physical defense 5% > 10%
- *Financial Settlement (aggro reduction) replace with another skill

### #28 Theory
- Aux Cores 2 >3
- Aerial Flashdance physical counterspike damage 400% > 550% (attempt to make counterspikes relevant at all)
- Conviction - Damage dealt to enemies targeting user increase 50% > 70% (She struggles to keep aggro because of low damage output, so this should solve both problems)

### #27 Praxis
- Aux Cores 1>2
- *Dexterity mod is useless due to The Awakened (Skill) (+50% acc at max affinity); Change her mod?
- *accuracy Up blade art is useless due to same reason; Change blade art?
- *Special 3 has increased damage from the side. If the payer has aggro it's useless; Find a way to decrease her aggro

### #23 Agathe
- *replace party damage buff with weaker kaiser zone? or increase it's value
- *bad blade arts?
- *insect advantage is very situational
- *has many damage increases agains toppled enemies. Captalize on that?

### #22 Azami
- Aux Cores 2
- Pain for Longing: affinity increase when teammate takes damage; At high trust ranks and setups such as hunter's chemestry, affinity maxes out almost instantly so this has little to no usefullness
  - Thinking of changing it to something that boosts defense at lower HP values, to make her main skill more exploitable
- Vendetta ether spike damage: 300%>450% (trying to make counterspikes more relevant)

### #21 Sever
- Special 3 Effect overlaps with his battle skills
- Heartless Kill: +400% damage on a surprise attack; same problem as finch's skill

### #16 Wulfric
Aux Core 2>3
- phys def 5% >
